# Project

BearTask is a task management platform, akin to that of Trello. It uses a similar board/list/card structure and has similar drag and drop functionality. 

## Project Setup

BearTask is a majority single page application using Backbone to manage MVC control and give the user the experience of smooth edits without page reload. The Backbone Views functionality is leveraged to render different editing modes, fields and to allow the user to traverse the page seamlessly.

## Testing

Testing pending. Will leverage Sauce labs to test javascript across multiple platforms.

`rake spec`

## Deploying

BearTask is deployed through Heroku.

## More to Come

- _Sidescrolling_
