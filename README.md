# Project

BearTask is a task management platform, akin to that of Trello. It uses a similar board/list/card structure and has similar drag and drop functionality. 

## Project Setup

BearTask is a majority single page application using Backbone to manage MVC control and give the user the experience of smooth edits without page reload. The Backbone Views functionality is leveraged to render different editing modes, fields and to allow the user to traverse the page seamlessly.
